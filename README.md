# CloudComputingProject-II - User Login System Using AWS Cognito and LAMP Stack  

In this project, I developed a secure user login system by integrating **AWS Cognito** with the **LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP)**. The system enables user authentication, registration, and session management while leveraging AWS Cognitoâ€™s scalable identity management features.  

Tools & Technologies Used 
- AWS Cognito: Implemented secure authentication, user management, and token-based authorization.  
- Linux (Ubuntu/CentOS): Configured the server environment for hosting the web application.  
- Apache: Set up and managed the web server to serve dynamic PHP content.  
- MySQL: Designed and implemented the database to store user details and session data.  
- PHP: Integrated AWS Cognito SDK, handled user authentication, and managed sessions.  
- JavaScript & AJAX: Enhanced user experience with real-time form validation and API calls.  
- AWS SDK for PHP: Communicated with AWS Cognito for user authentication and token verification.  

Key Skills Gained  
- Cloud Authentication: Gained expertise in AWS Cognito for secure authentication and identity management.  
- Full-Stack Development: Combined front-end and back-end development using LAMP.  
- Security Best Practices: Implemented password encryption, token-based authentication, and session management.  
- API Integration: Worked with AWS SDK to connect Cognito with PHP.  
- Server & Database Management: Set up and optimized Apache and MySQL for efficient performance.  

This project enhanced my understanding of secure authentication, cloud-based identity management, and full-stack web development, making it a valuable addition to my skillset.
All the code, and other assets that I have used in making the projects are mentioned in the project file-"INTERNSHIP LIVE PROJECT 2 FILE".
